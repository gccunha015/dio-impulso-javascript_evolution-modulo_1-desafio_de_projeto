# Creating a GitHub repository
## About
This repository is a challenge that aims the practice of **Git** commands and **GitHub** interaction. The **Git** commands used were:
- `git init` : initialize repository
- `git remote add origin REMOTE_LOCATION` : add **origin** remote repository
- `git add *` : track all files
- `git status` : view status of tracked files
- `git commit -m "MESSAGE"` : commit with message description
- `git push --set-upstream origin main` : push to remote **origin** and set it as upstream of **main**
- `git pull --rebase` : get updates from remote repository and show conflicts locally
- `git rebase --continue` : mark tracked files conflicts as resolves

## Why
This repository is a challenge of the **JavaScript Evolution** bootcamp offered by **[Impulso]** and **[Digital Innovation One]**.
